          <h3>Why are you interested in working for this company?</h3>
          <p class="joke-text">
            - Of course, the honest answer may be, “I need to pay my rent and
            I'm hoping to buy a 72" plasma TV.” But this is no time for honesty.
            The interviewer wants to hear that you're an ambitious go-getter who
            is enthusiastic about learning new things and genuinely passionate
            about this field of work.

          <h3>What has been your greatest achievement?</h3>
          <p class="joke-text">
            - Remember to keep it professional here. You may hold the record for
            the greatest number of hot dogs eaten in ten minutes, but your
            prospective employer wants to hear about what you have accomplished
            in your professional life. Think about academic achievements, big
            projects you've worked on, commendations from previous employers, or
            moments when you have reached particular milestones in your
            professional life. Don't explain the what, but explain WHY it was so
            important to you or your company.

          <h3>What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</h3>
          <p class="joke-text">
            - This question is quite a tricky one. There is a fine line between
            criticising yourself too much and sounding boastful. When talking
            about your weaknesses, focus on how you have overcome those
            weaknesses to become a better employee. This way you're sneakily
            talking about strengths without sounding too big-headed.

          <h3>What did you like best and least about your last job?</h3>
          <p class="joke-text">
            - ou may have hated your last job and everyone who worked there, but
            this is not the place to reveal that. Prospective employers want to
            hear positivity and good vibes from you. So remember to focus on
            work-related aspects that you enjoyed; for example, you could say
            you enjoyed opportunity to learn from more experienced employees and
            the supportive environment created by the managers.

          <h3>What would you like to be doing five years from now?</h3>
          <p class="joke-text">
            - Ambition is a key requirement of any employee. If your prospective
            boss thinks you want to be successful, then he or she will presume
            you're going to work pretty hard. So, what should you say here?
            Well, this questions depends on the role you are applying for and
            the opportunities for career progression.ß
